Regina Raw Signature Directory
------------------------------

This directory contains a census of splitting surface signatures as
generated by Regina.  For space considerations only signatures of order
at most 7 are included.

Note that the directory above this includes topology data files
containing the enclosing triangulations of signatures from this census
satisfying various constraints.

Signature files within this directory are of the following types.

*.sig:
    These are plain text files containing all splitting surface
    signatures of a given order.  Each individual signature is written
    on a separate line.

    For brevity, brackets are omitted and cycles are separated by periods.
    For instance, the signature '(aab)(bc)(c)' is written as 'aab.bc.c'.

*.sig.bz2:
    These are bzipped signature files, used when the raw signature files
    are very large.  These files can be uncompressed using the bzip2
    utility which is available from http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/
    or your favourite GNU/Linux distribution.
