Regina Census and Sample File Directory
---------------------------------------

This directory contains a number of censuses of triangulations of
different types.  Each census data file includes a text packet
containing a full description of the census including its origin.

Also within this directory is a number of sample files that illustrate how
Regina can be used.  A good starting point is sample-misc.rga, which can
be opened directly from within the main user interface.

Most of these census and sample data files can be accessed easily through
the "File -> Open Example" menu when running Regina.

The subdirectory sigs/ contains a series of plain text files representing
a census of splitting surface signatures.  See sigs/README.txt for further
details.

Files within this directory are of the following types.

*.rga:
    These are topology data files.  They can be opened directly from within
    the main user interface.

*.session:
    These are complete transcripts of sample python sessions, including
    both user input and program output.  You can start a python session
    from the command line by running "regina-python".

*.py:
    These are the same sample python sessions as above but only the user
    input has been included.  These scripts may be fed directly into Regina
    using a command of the form "regina-python foo.py"
