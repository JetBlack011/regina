This directory contains a number of sample files that illustrate how
Regina can be used.

*.rga:
    These are topology data files.  They can be opened directly from within
    the user interface.

*.session:
    These are complete transcripts of sample Jython sessions, including
    both user input and program output.  You can start a Jython session
    from the command line using "regina --console".

*.py:
    These are the same sample Jython sessions as above but only the user
    input has been included.  These scripts may be fed directly into Regina
    using a command of the form "regina --text < foo.py"
