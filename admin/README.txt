Regina Administrative Utilities
-------------------------------

This directory contains:

- Various adminstrative utilities for housekeeping and making new releases;

- Components of the standard build infrastructure, such as libtool and
  the KDE admin directory [*].

In general only the software author(s) should need to worry about the
contents of this directory.

For general information on building or running Regina, see README.txt in
the top-level source directory (the directory above this one).


[*] Some of these standard components have been patched for Regina.
    These patches are recorded in the file admin.patch, and should be
    reapplied and/or updated each time the standard components are
    resynced with their upstream sources.
