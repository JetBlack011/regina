This is a stripped-down version of the syntax-highlighting framework from
KDE Frameworks 5.28.0:

- it has been simplified (and silently drops some metadata from the syntax
  definitions as a result);
- its Qt dependencies have been replaced with libraries that are already used
  by Regina's calculation engine (e.g., the C++ standard library and libxml2);
- some unicode awareness in the rules is lost (specifically, hard-coded strings
  and characters in the rules are assumed to be plain ASCII);
- dynamic rules (which use regex captures instead of hard-coded strings) are
  not supported;
- its repository is hard-coded to only load syntax definitions for Python
  from Regina's data directories (though the library retains the functionality
  for highlighting arbitrary languages if the syntax definitions are provided).

The original KDE framework was downloaded on 21 Nov 2016 from:
