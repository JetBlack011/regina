<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Debian:  Sid (Unstable)</a></h1>

<p>
Debian packages for Regina are not distributed from the SourceForge site.
</p>
<p>
Instead, users of Sid (the Debian unstable release) may obtain packages
from the usual Debian servers.  Debian Sid always ships with the latest
version of Regina, which means that you can install Regina just like you
would any other package:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ aptitude install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Regina is split into several packages for Debian.  To start
with you will probably just want the <tt>regina-normal</tt> package.
If you are doing Python scripting and/or compiling Regina's mathematical core
into your own code, you may want the <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt> and
<tt>regina-normal-doc</tt> packages also.
The <tt>regina-normal-mpi</tt> package is available for users running long
census calculations on clusters.
</p>
<p>
Please note that new versions of Regina might not appear on the Debian
servers until a few days after their release.
