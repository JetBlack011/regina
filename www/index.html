<h3>News</h3>

Version 4.1 is out, including 3-sphere recognition, connected sum
decomposition, usability enhancements and more!  See the
<a href="docs/history.html">release notes</a> for further information.
<p>
As of version 3.95 (12 October 2003), the user interface has been completely
rewritten in C++ (using the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> libraries).
Furthermore, scripting in Regina now uses standard
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, not Jython.
As a result, Regina should be somewhat easier to build, install
and support than it has been in the past.

<h3><a name="whatis">What is Regina?</a></h3>

Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
It focuses upon the study of 3-manifold triangulations and includes
support for normal surfaces and angle structures.
<p>
Its primary uses (in the author's opinion) include:
<ul>
    <li>the ability to analyse in detail 3-manifold triangulations
    too complex to study by hand;</li>
    <li>the ability to combine the census feature with inbuilt scripting to run
    tests on all 3-manifolds of a given type.</li>
</ul>
See the reference manual for a <a href="docs/featureset.html">full list
of features</a>.

<h3><a name="download">Download</a></h3>

Regina is now offered as a source distribution only.
Prebuilt binaries are no longer available since they
depend so heavily upon precisely which external libraries are installed
and where.  However, as of version 3.95 Regina is somewhat easier to
build than it has been in the past (in particular, it is built and
installed in the same way as any other KDE application).
<p>
Before you download, be sure to visit the <a href="sysreq.html">system
requirements page</a>.  Regina needs several other pieces of software
installed before it will run.
<p>
The source archive <tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>_src.tgz</b></tt>
can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19698">SourceForge
project site</a>.  This unpacks into the directory
<tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>/</b></tt>, which contains a file
<tt><b>README.txt</b></tt> containing instructions for compiling the
application.  If you have trouble compiling or running Regina, you can
check the <a href="docs/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting page</a> to
see if your problem is discussed there.
<p>
Be aware of the <a href="docs/credits.html">GNU General Public
License</a>, which is also contained in the downloadable archives.
<p>
Note that some GNU/Linux distributions may offer
packages for Regina (certainly
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> does).

<h3><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h3>

The Regina Reference Manual is installed with Regina and is available through
the <i>Help</i> menu.  Note that it requires the KDE Help Centre to be
present, although this is provided with most KDE installations.
<p>
Alternatively, the reference manual can be <a href="docs/index.html">viewed
here online</a> with any web browser.
<p>
There is also extensive API documentation available for the calculation
engine.  This is useful for Python scripting or for building the Regina
calculation engine into your own projects (the calculation engine is
provided as a shared library).
<p>
The API documentation will be built and installed with Regina, as long
as you have Doxygen installed (see the <a href="sysreq.html">system
requirements</a> for details).  Alternatively, it can be
<a href="engine-docs/modules.html">viewed here online</a> with any
web browser.

<h3><a name="announce">Announcement Mailing List</a></h3>

A mailing list (<i>regina-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</i>) has been
created for important announcements such as new releases of Regina.
This list has extremely low traffic.  You can
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/regina-announce">subscribe
or unsubscribe here</a>.
<p>
Other mailing lists have been created for user support and development
discussons; see below for details.
<p>

<h3><a name="contact">Contact / Comments / Suggestions</a></h3>

If you have any suggestions, problems, bugs, wishes, frustrations or
otherwise miscellaneous comments, I would <i>really</i> love to hear
them.  This program is permanently under development and I would like to
hear what people want out of it.
<p>
Alternatively, if you have written additions yourself and think they
could be useful in the general release, I would love to hear about them.
The more the merrier!  It's probably worth mailing me first though in
case I or someone else have already written said addition and it's
currently being debugged and two days away from release.
<p>
Incidentally, even if you have no comments to make, I'd like to hear
from anyone using the program - even if it's just to say hi -
mainly because I'm interested to see
who's using it and how it's being used.
<p>
The best way to contact me is by email at
<a href="mailto:bab@debian.org">bab@debian.org</a>.
But even better, you could use the SourceForge services which include a
<a href="docs/services.html">bug tracking system and mailing lists</a>;
this way you can ensure your problems and/or discussions are publicly
archived to help others with similar issues.
