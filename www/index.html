<h2>News</h2>

<i>27 March 2006:</i>
Version 4.3 is out!  Many of the changes have been to support the new
10-tetrahedron non-orientable census, but there are other improvements also;
see the <a href="docs/history.html">release notes</a> for details.
As usual, <a href="#download">packages are available</a> for several GNU/Linux
distributions.
<p>
<i><a href="#contents">(Back to contents...)</a></i>

<h2><a name="whatis">What is Regina?</a></h2>

Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
It focuses upon the study of 3-manifold triangulations and includes
support for normal surfaces and angle structures.
<p>
See the reference manual for a <a href="docs/featureset.html">full list
of features</a>.
<p>
<i><a href="#contents">(Back to contents...)</a></i>

<h2><a name="screenshots">Screenshots</a></h2>

A few screenshots are available.

<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>

Prebuilt packages for Regina are available for the following GNU/Linux
distributions.  Most packages are available from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19698">Regina
download site</a> (the few exceptions are noted below).  All of the
packages are named <tt>regina-normal</tt> to avoid conflicting with the
<a href="http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/">other Regina</a>.
<blockquote><table cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center class="data">
<tr><th class="first">Distribution</th><th>Versions</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td class="first">Debian</td>
    <td>Sarge and above</td>
    <td>Packages are kept elsewhere; see the <i>README.debian</i> files
    on the download site for details.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="first">Fedora Core</td>
    <td>3, 4 and 5</td>
    <td>Some triangulation icons might appear broken; this is because
    of a bug in Fedora's default <i>Bluecurve</i> icon theme.<br>
    Regina 4.3.1 will contain a workaround; in the meantime this can be
    fixed by changing your icon theme to <i>Crystal SVG</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="first">Mandriva</td>
    <td>10.1, 10.2 (Limited Edition 2005) and 2006.0</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="first">SuSE</td>
    <td>9.2, 9.3 and 10.0</td>
    <td>Scripting is disabled on SuSE 10.0 because their boost packages
    are broken (they have chosen
    <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=137558">not
    to fix this until SuSE 10.1</a>).<br>
    The SuSE 10.0 icons also suffer from the same problem as Fedora Core
    (see above).  This can be worked around by changing your icon theme
    from the default <i>Crystal SUSE</i> to <i>Crystal SVG</i> instead.<br>
    The API documentation is broken on SuSE 9.3 because their
    doxygen is buggy; you can always
    <a href="engine-docs/modules.html">read the API documentation
    here</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="first" colspan=3>All of these packages have been built on
<b>fully updated machines</b> (all security and other recommended
updates installed).  You might need to update your machine also.</td></tr>

<p>
For other platforms or distributions, Regina is available in source form
only.  These sources are available from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19698">Regina
download site</a>.  Please see the <a href="source.html">separate page on
building Regina</a> for further information on how to build Regina and
what libraries and tools you will need to have installed.
<p>
If you are having trouble either compiling or running Regina, you may
check the <a href="docs/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting page</a> to
see if your problem is discussed there.  You are of course also welcome
to write to either myself or the users' mailing list
<a href="mailto:regina-user@lists.sourceforge.net"><i>regina-user@lists.sourceforge.net</i></a>
for assistance.
<p>
<b>Packaging help requested:</b> Is the download page missing your
distribution (e.g., Slackware, Darwin/Fink) or your hardware
(e.g., AMD64, PowerPC)?  If so, and if you're willing to help out with
packaging, please <a href="packaging.html">visit this page</a>!  It may
be as easy as rebuilding an RPM on your machine.

<h2><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h2>

The Regina Reference Manual is installed with Regina and is available through
the <i>Help</i> menu.  Note that it requires the KDE Help Centre to be
present, although this is provided with most KDE installations.
<p>
Alternatively, the reference manual can be <a href="docs/index.html">viewed
here online</a> with any web browser.
<p>
There is also extensive API documentation available for the calculation
engine.  This is useful for Python scripting or for building the Regina
calculation engine into your own projects (the calculation engine is
provided as a shared library).
<p>
If you are building Regina from sources, the API documentation will be
installed as long as you have Doxygen on your system (see the
<a href="source.html#sysreq">system requirements</a> for details).
Alternatively, the API documentation can be
<a href="engine-docs/modules.html">viewed here online</a> with any
web browser.

<h2><a name="announce">Announcement Mailing List</a></h2>

A mailing list (<i>regina-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</i>) has been
created for important announcements such as new releases of Regina.
This list has extremely low traffic.  You can
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/regina-announce">subscribe
or unsubscribe here</a>.
<p>
Other mailing lists have been created for user support and development
discussons; see the <a href="#contact">contact section below</a>.

<h2><a name="contact">Contact / Comments / Suggestions</a></h2>

If you have any suggestions, problems, bugs, wishes, frustrations or
otherwise miscellaneous comments, I would <i>really</i> love to hear
them.  This program is permanently under development and I would like to
hear what people want out of it.
<p>
Alternatively, if you have written additions yourself and think they
could be useful in the general release, I would love to hear about them.
The more the merrier!  It's probably worth mailing me first though in
case I or someone else have already written said addition and it's
currently being debugged and two days away from release.
<p>
Incidentally, even if you have no comments to make, I'd like to hear
from anyone using the program - even if it's just to say hi -
mainly because I'm interested to see
who's using it and how it's being used.
<p>
The best way to contact me is by email at
<a href="mailto:bab@debian.org">bab@debian.org</a>.
But even better, you could use the SourceForge services which include a
<a href="docs/services.html">bug tracking system and mailing lists</a>;
this way you can ensure your problems and/or discussions are publicly
archived to help others with similar issues.
