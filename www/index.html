<h3><a name="whatis">What is Regina?</a></h3>

Regina is essentially a topological calculator with a bent towards
normal surface theory.  It allows 3-manifolds to be created, manipulated
and their properties of interest determined.
<p>
Its primary uses (in my opinion) include:
<ul>
	<li>the ability to examine 3-manifolds too complex to study by hand;</li>
	<li>the ability to use the census feature to run tests on
		all 3-manifolds of a given type;</li>
	<li>the ability to bring my PhD thesis closer to completion.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="download">Download</a></h3>

Both binary and source downloads are available from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/regina/">SourceForge
project site</a>.  Be aware of the
<a href="#license">GPL License</a> as described above, which is also
contained in the downloadable archives.
<ul>
	<li><b>Linux binaries:</b>
		Archive <tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>_bin.tgz</b></tt> contains a

		The application will be extracted into directory
		<tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>/</b></tt>.  Instructions for running the
		application are included in
		<tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>/README.txt</b></tt>.
	<li><b>Windows binaries:</b>
		Currently only linux downloads are available.  I'm still
		working on windows support; I'll post windows binaries
		when they're ready.

		Archive <tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>_src.tgz</b></tt> contains a complete

<h3><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h3>

The documentation for Regina can be <a href="docs/">viewed
here online</a>.
<p>
There are several ways of obtaining the documentation on your machine.
It is recommended that you use a custom help browser (this can be set up
through the <i>Options-Help Browser</i> menu item), since the internal
JavaHelp system has problems with some of the HTML.
<ul>
	<li>If you wish to use a custom help browser from inside Regina or
	if you wish to browse the documentation from outside Regina,
	download archive <tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>_doc.tgz</b></tt>.
	This will extract the documentation into directory
	<tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>/docs/normal/docs/</b></tt>.

	<li>If you wish to use Regina's internal help browsing system, you
	can download the jar archive
	<tt><b>regina-docs-<i>version</i>.jar</b></tt>.
	Rename this to <tt><b>regina-docs.jar</b></tt>
	and the help browser will use this jar
	as is; there is no need to unpack it.  You will need to run
	<tt><b>regconf</b></tt> to tell the internal help browser where to
	find this jar.

	<li>You can generate the documentation from the sources.
	Move to the main
	<tt><b>regina-<i>version</i>/</b></tt> directory and type <tt><b>make
	bindocs</b></tt>.  The documentation will be generated in the
	subdirectory <tt><b>docs/normal/docs/</b></tt>
	and a complete documentation jar <tt><b>regina-docs.jar</b></tt> will
	be created in the subdirectory <tt><b>bin/</b></tt>.
</ul>
<p>
To extract archive <tt><b>stuff.tgz</b></tt>, type
<tt><b>tar -zxf stuff.tgz</b></tt>.

<img src="normalicon.gif" alt="Icon for Normal 1.0" hspace=10 vspace=5
align="right">In 1997 in Melbourne, David Letscher,
Richard Rannard and myself under
the guidance of Hyam Rubinstein planned out a program that would do
normal surface theory and everything else besides.  Much groundwork
planning was done, epsilon code was written and then things kind of
faded away.  David Letscher revived the project on his own and in 1999
presented Normal 1.0.  This program performed triangulation
simplification and found vertex normal surfaces, was written in Java and
was a proof-of-concept program that normal surface theory was
computationally feasible.
<p>
In March 1999, David Letscher and I sat down to write a new version of
the program from scratch.  The new version would have a calculation
engine written in C++ for speed and would have a Java GUI for
portability and for (imho) the cool things that Java provides for
writing interfaces (and I know there are people who will disagree with
me on this, but hey).  It would be carefully designed and written with
rigour and extensibility in mind, allowing for the possibility of
add-ons written by other people.
<p>
David however leads a busy life and pulled out of the project, but
remains to offer fabulous technical advice.  In late 2000 a prerelease of the
new program was ready (under an appropriate definition of `ready') and
voila, here we are today.

<h3><a name="contact">Contact / Comments / Suggestions</a></h3>

If you have any suggestions, problems, bugs, wishes, frustrations or
otherwise miscellaneous comments, I would <i>really</i> love to hear
them.  This program is permanently under development and I would like to
hear what people want out of it.
<p>
Alternatively, if you have written additions yourself and think they
could be useful in the general release, I would love to hear about them.
The more the merrier!  It's probably worth mailing me first though in
case I or someone else have already written said addition and it's
currently being debugged and two days away from release.
<p>
Incidentally, even if you have no comments to make, I'd like to hear
from anyone using the program - even if it's just to say hi -
mainly because I'm interested to see
who's using it and how it's being used.

<h3><a name="who">Who is Regina?</a></h3>

This normal surface theory calculator has been named after 
<a href="http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~rb/">Regina Basman</a>
who once told me she was the most normal person I knew.  She's doing a
mathematics PhD, reads cool books and sometimes draws people, and she likes
running around rainforests in the dark.
