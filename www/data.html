This page provides supporting data that complements Regina, including
topology data files and explanatory documents.

<h3><a name="census">Census Data:</a></h3>

Included in the Regina distribution are topology data files for several
different censuses of triangulations.  These census data files can be
found in the <tt>examples/</tt> directory of the source distribution, or
in the <tt>/usr/local/share/regina/examples/</tt> directory of the
binary distribution.
<p>
These topology data files, as well as additional files that are too
large to ship with Regina, are made available here for download.
<p>
Each census data file includes a text packet containing a full
description of the census as well as its origin.  Data from other
sources (such as the hyperbolic census shipped with SnapPea) has been
converted into Regina data files.

<h3><a name="thesis">PhD Thesis:</a></h3>

The author's PhD thesis was submitted on 30 May 2003 and contains
detailed descriptions of many of the topological structures, concepts
and algorithms used in Regina.
<p>
This thesis will be made available from this page in the near future.
