<h3><a name="cygwin">Installing DocBook Tools</a></h3>

Visit the <a href="sysreq.html#docs">system requirements page</a>
and download all of the software you need; this should include
the DocBook SGML DTD, the DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, the ISO
entity sets and Jade.
<p>
Make a directory on your system for SGML-related tools (such as
<tt>c:\sgml</tt> and unpack each of these software bundles in
its own directory beneath it.  For instance, you might have
<tt>c:\sgml\docbook</tt>, <tt>c:\sgml\docbook-dsssl</tt>,
<tt>c:\sgml\isoents</tt> and <tt>c:\sgml\jade</tt>.
<p>
Set the following two environment variables.  Windows NT and
2000 users should do this through the control panel (select
<i>System</i> and look for <i>Environment Variables</i>);
Windows 95 and 98 users should do this in <tt>autoexec.bat</tt>
(which will require a reboot, go figure).
<ul>
 <li><b>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</b> - This should be a semicolon-separated
 list of the catalog files installed with the DocBook SGML DTD, the
 DocBook DSSSL stylesheets and Jade.  You should prepend <tt>.\catalog</tt>
 to this list.  An example is:<br>
 <center>
  <tt>.\catalog;c:\sgml\docbook\docbook.cat;c:\sgml\docbook-dsssl\catalog;c:\sgml\jade\catalog</tt>
 </center></li>
 <li><b>SGML_SEARCH_PATH</b> - This should be a semicolon-separated
 list of all the directories in which you have just unpacked software.
 You should prepend <tt>.</tt> to this list.  An example is:<br>
 <center>
  <tt>.;c:\sgml\docbook;c:\sgml\docbook-dsssl;c:\sgml\isoents;c:\sgml\jade</tt>
 </center></li>
</ul>
<p>
But we're not done yet.  The ISO entity files will all need to be renamed.
They currently have names like <tt>ISOamsa</tt>, <tt>ISOgrk1</tt> and the like.
You need to change these names to <tt>iso-amsa.gml</tt>, <tt>iso-grk1.gml</tt> and
the like.  You can either do this by hand (there were 19 files last time I looked),
or if you have Cygwin installed with the appropriate packages (see the
<a href="cygwin.html#cygwin">Cygwin support page</a> for details)
then you can fire up a bash shell, change to the corresponding
directory (remember that <tt>C:\</tt> can be found in bash as <tt>/cygdrive/c/</tt>) and
enter the following command:
<ul>
<li><tt>for i in ISO*; do mv $i `echo $i | sed -e s/ISO/iso-/`.gml; done</tt></li>
</ul>
And we're done!  Now you can run up a Cygwin shell, go to the main Regina
source directory, run <tt>make docshtml</tt> and see what happens!
