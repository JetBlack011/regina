<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Debian:  Etch (Debian 4.0)</a></h1>

<p>
Debian packages for Regina are not distributed from the SourceForge site.
</p>
<p>
Instead, users of Etch (the Debian 4.0 stable release) may obtain
packages from the repository on people.debian.org.  These packages
are available for the <b>i386</b> and <b>amd64</b> architectures.
To install them:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
   Add Regina's location to your list of repositories.
   </p>
   <p>
   This only needs to be done once (the first time you install Regina).
   Open the file <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> and add the following line:
   </p>
   <div class="example"><p>
   <tt>deb http://people.debian.org/~bab/regina/ etch main</tt>
   </p></div>
   </li>
<li><p>
   Update the list of available packages.
   </p>
   <p>
   This lets your package manager know that a new version of Regina is
   available.  How you do this depends on which package manager you use;
   an example for aptitude users is given below.
   </p>
   <div class="example"><p>
   <tt>example$ aptitude update</tt>
   </p></div>
   </li>
<li><p>
   Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.
   </p>
   <p>
   Again how you do this depends on which package manager you use.
   Aptitude users might run the following command:
   </p>
   <div class="example"><p>
   <tt>example$ aptitude install regina-normal</tt>
   </p></div>
   <p>
   At this point your package manager should download and install Regina
   along with any necessary dependencies.
   </p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
Regina is split into several packages for Debian.  To start
with you will probably just want the <tt>regina-normal</tt> package.
If you are doing Python scripting and/or compiling Regina's mathematical core
into your own code, you may want the <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt> and
<tt>regina-normal-doc</tt> packages also.  The
<tt>regina-normal-mpi</tt> package is available for users running long
census calculations on clusters.
</p>
<p>
You might have noticed that Etch already ships with Regina as part of its
CD/DVD set.  However, this is the older version 4.3.1 (which was current
when Etch was released).  For a newer version of Regina you should follow
the steps outlined above.
