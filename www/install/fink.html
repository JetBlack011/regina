<h1><a name="contents">Regina for MacOS X:  Fink Packages</a></h1>

<p>
Regina now builds and runs under MacOS X, thanks to the
<a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink project</a>.
</p>
<p>
To run Regina, you will need:
<ul>
<li><p><i>A working source-based Fink installation:</i></p>
<p>
Fink can be used as a binary distribution (download pre-built packages
only) or as a source distribution (automatically build each package from
sources on your machine).  To run Regina
<b>you will need the source distribution</b>, since the binary packages
for Fink are too old and do not include all of the required software.
</p>
<p>
You will also need the Apple XCode/Developer Tools (this allows you to
build Fink packages) and the Apple X11 distribution including both
the X11User and X11SDK packages (this allows you to build packages with
graphical user interfaces).
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/download/">Quick Start page</a>
on the Fink website explains how you can get all of this up and running.
</p>
<p>
Regina is known to work on MacOS 10.4 (Tiger) with both the Fink stable
and unstable branches.  It builds happily on MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) with
the Fink unstable branch, but the author has not been able to test it
personally.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>The Fink info file for Regina:</i></p>
<p>
The info file is a short text file that tells Fink how to build and
install Regina.  You can download it
<a href="fink/stable/regina-normal.info">here for the Fink stable
branch</a>, or
<a href="fink/unstable/regina-normal.info">here for the Fink unstable
branch</a>.
Copy it into <tt>/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/</tt>
so that Fink can find it:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ sudo cp regina-normal.info /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Users of the Fink unstable branch can skip this step, since
Regina is now included in the Fink distribution.  Please note though
that new versions of Regina might not appear in the Fink archive until
several weeks after their release.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can now build and install Regina as you would any other Fink
package:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ fink install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Be prepared to wait, since Fink might need to download and build
additional components such as the Boost and KDE libraries.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to build Regina into your own C++ projects, you will also
need the Regina development package:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ fink install regina-normal-dev</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
MacOS X support is relatively new for Regina, so please do mail me
at <i>bab@debian.org</i> if you run into difficulties.
It is hoped that future releases of Regina can be
offered as standalone pre-build Mac applications (the sort that you
simply drag onto the hard drive), but we shall see how that goes.
