BINARY DISTRIBUTION:

    - To run, type "./regina".

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION:

    - Before compiling, copy one of the template Makefile.options.* files
      to Makefile.options and edit it to reflect your system.
    - To compile so you have a basic working runtime, type "make binjni".
    - To build the documentation, type "make bindocs".  The documentation
      will be generated and placed in docs/.  A complete documentation
      jar will also be placed in bin/.
    - For other make options, type "make help".

    Be sure to examine Makefile.options to ensure that the configuration
    matches your system.
