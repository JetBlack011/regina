Regina Python Library Directory
-------------------------------

This directory contains various prepackaged Python libraries that might
be of use.

To use these libraries from within Regina, add them through the Regina
configuration dialog.  Alternatively, you can add them directly to
the file ~/.regina-libs, which should contain a list of library files,
one per line.

Any libraries referenced in ~/.regina-libs will be loaded automatically
at the beginning of each Regina python session.  See the reference
manual for further details.
