Java User Interface TODO List
-----------------------------

Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

Everywhere:
    Disable X-closing for all windows and dialogs except for main window
        (necessary to ensure progress dialogs cannot be closed).
    Allow customisation of types in drop-down boxes

Jython:
    Allow breaking processing in console
    Check to see whether user libraries are text files
    Syntax highlighting for script editor
    Autoindent in script editor
    Compile and run open libraries.

Main Window:
    Implement undo.
    Use actions in NormalFrame and SystemPane.
    Have the GUI refuse to export invalid triangulations.

Menus:
    Provide NTriangulation::isIsomorphicTo().

Normal Surfaces:
    For matching equations and normal surface coordinates, resizing one
        column should imply resizing all coordinate columns.
    Right-align coordinates but have padding between numbers and column edge.
    Allow modification of SurfaceViewer.maxAutoCalcTetrahedra.

Scripts:
    Expand file args using cygpath (and alter docs accordingly).

Triangulations:
    Support searching through a census for a triangulation.
