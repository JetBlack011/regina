Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

(Applet):
 	Include Java plug-in support
 	Get this working on more browsers.

CORBA:
	Local (client-side) imports and exports

Debian:
	Support both earlier and later j2sdk1.3.

	Use actions in NormalFrame and SystemPane.
	Allow filenames to be passed to the GUI from the command line.

Menus:
	Provide NTriangulation::isIsomorphicTo().

Normal Surfaces:
 	For matching equations and normal surface coordinates, resizing one
		column should imply resizing all coordinate columns.
	Right-align coordinates but have padding between numbers and column edge.
	Allow modification of SurfaceViewer.maxAutoCalcTetrahedra.

Scripts:
	Expand $REGINA_JNIDIR and $REGINA_EXTRA_CLASSES using cygpath.
