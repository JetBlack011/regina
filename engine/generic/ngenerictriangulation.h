         * Two triangulations are \e isomorphic if and only it is
         * possible to relabel their top-dimensional simplices and the
         * (<i>dim</i>+1) vertices of each simplex in a way that makes
         * the two triangulations combinatorially identical, as returned
         * by isIdenticalTo().
         *
         * Equivalently, two triangulations are isomorphic if and only if
         * there is a one-to-one and onto boundary complete combinatorial
         * isomorphism from this triangulation to \a other, as described
         * in the Isomorphism class notes.
         *
         * In particular, note that this triangulation and \a other must
         * contain the same number of top-dimensional simplices for such an
         * isomorphism to exist.
         *
         * If the triangulations are isomorphic, then this routine returns
         * one such boundary complete isomorphism (i.e., one such relabelling).
         * The isomorphism will be newly constructed, and to assist with
         * memory management, it will be returned as a std::auto_ptr.
         * Thus, to test whether an isomorphism exists without having to
         * explicitly manage with the isomorphism itself, you can just call
         * <tt>if (isIsomorphicTo(other).get())</tt>, in which case the newly
         * created isomorphism (if it exists) will be automatically
         * destroyed.
         *
         * There may be many such isomorphisms between the two triangulations.
         * If you need to find \e all such isomorphisms, you may call
         * findAllIsomorphisms() instead.
         *
         * If you need to ensure that top-dimensional simplices are labelled
         * the same in both triangulations (i.e., that the triangulations are
         * related by the \e identity isomorphism), you should call the
         * stricter test isIdenticalTo() instead.
