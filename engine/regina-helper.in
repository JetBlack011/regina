Usage: $0 { cpp | cc } [-f, --force] [-r, --rpath]

Writes a sample C++ program that uses Regina, as well as a corresponding
Makefile, in the current directory.

The C++ filename extension will be whichever action you passed (cpp or cc).

Optional arguments:
    -f, --force : Overwrite any existing files.
    -r, --rpath : Always include an rpath option in the Makefile (useful when
                  your Regina installation is not on the standard library path).
                  By default, an rpath option will only be added if you are
                  running directly out of Regina's source tree.

Usage: $0 installtype

Identifies the type of Regina installation.

Possible results:
    XDG     : Running from an installation in a fixed location that follows the
              freedesktop.org layout.  This is seen with Regina's GNU/Linux
              packages, as well as local CMake builds with no special arguments.
    HPC     : Running from a slimmed-down installation (e.g., no GUI or HTML
              docs) in a fixed but possibly non-standard location, suitable
              for builds on HPC systems.  This is typically seen with local
              CMake builds where REGINA_INSTALL_TYPE was explicitly set to HPC.
    Bundle  : Running from within Regina's macOS app bundle.  This is seen with
              Regina's macOS app, as well as local Xcode builds.
    Windows : Running from within Regina's Windows app.  This is seen with
              Regina's Windows app, as well as local builds that follow the
              (intricate and unsupported) msys2/mingw-w64 build process.
    Source  : Running directly from Regina's source tree (i.e., a local build
              that has not been installed).
