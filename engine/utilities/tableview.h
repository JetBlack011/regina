/**
 * A lightweight object that can be used for random access
 * to all elements of a given multi-dimensional table.
 *
 * This access is read-only, in the sense that both the table itself and the
 * table elements are read-only.  (Of course, if the table elements are
 * non-const pointers then this means that the \e pointers cannot be reassigned
 * to point to different objects, but the objects they \e point to can still
 * be modified.)
 *
 * This class is in a sense a multi-dimensional analogue to TableView
 * (though it does also support one-dimensional tables).
 *
 * Where this class differs from ListView is:
 *
 * - TableView supports multi-dimensional tables, whereas ListView only
 *   supports one-dimensional lists.
 *
 * - TableView offers a smaller set of member functions, whereas ListView
 *   has a richer interface.
 *
 * - TableView is (for now) only designed to work with fixed-size C-style
 *   arrays of the form <tt>Element[a][b]...[z]</tt>, where the array
 *   dimensions are compile-time constants.  In contrast, ListView can also
 *   work with rich C++ container classes and variable-sized C-style arrays.
 *
 * - While ListView has a purpose in C++ (to hide the "real" type used
 *   by the underlying implementation), TableView is primary for the Python
 *   bindings: its main benefit is to strictly enforce read-only access
 *   (since Python loses all knowledge of constness, and sometimes allows
 *   users to change things that they should not).  Typically TableView
 *   would be used to wrap global constant arrays (such as regina::quadDefn,
 *   or regina::Edge<3>::edgeNumber).
 *
 * TableView comes with deduction guides for tables of dimension â‰¤ 3.
 * This means that you can simply create a TableView using the syntax
 * <tt>TableView(array)</tt>, where \a array is the underlying C-style array,
 * without having to specify any TableView template arguments.
 *
 * TableView objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
 * std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
 * functions.
 *
 * \ifacespython The TableView classes are deliberately difficult to access:
 * they live within their own private Python namespaces, and are all given the
 * same class name (\a TableView).  You would typically only interact with a
 * TableView when accessing a constant array (e.g., Edge<3>::edgeNumber).
 * In most cases you would simply use array-like operators to access the
 * elements of such a table without ever knowing its exact type.
 *
 * \tparam Element the type of element stored in the C-style array.
 * This should not be a \c const type; the \c const modifier will be added
 * automatically where necessary through the class interface.
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimensions of the C-style array.  There must always be at
 * least one dimension supplied.
