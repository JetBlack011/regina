.SH NAME
tricensus-manager \- Distribute a triangulation census amongst several    machines
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtricensus-manager\fR [ \fB\fItricensus-options\fB\fR ] \fB\fIpairs-file-prefix\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Allows multiple processes, possibly running on different machines, to
collaborate in forming a census of 3-manifold triangulations.
.PP
Census generation should take place in a single directory; if the
census is to be distributed amongst different machines, this directory
should be on a filesystem to which they all have access.
.PP
In preparing a census to be distributed amongst several processes or
machines, it should first be split into several smaller pieces.
Running \fBtricensus\fR
with option \fB--genpairs\fR (which is quite fast) will create
a list of face pairings, each of which must be analysed in order to
complete the census.  The census is split into pieces by subdividing
this list of face pairings.
.PP
A common file prefix (such as \fI6-or\fR) should be
selected.  Each subset of face pairings should be stored (one face
pairing per line) in a file whose name begins with this prefix and
ends with \fI.pairs\fR.  For instance, if
\fBtricensus\fR with option \fB--genpairs\fR
produced 10 face pairings, these might be split into five files, each
with two lines representing two of these face pairings, named
\fI6-or-0.pairs\fR, \fI6-or-1.pairs\fR,
\fI6-or-2.pairs\fR, \fI6-or-3.pairs\fR and
\fI6-or-4.pairs\fR respectively.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
Each face pairing that is processed \fBmust\fR be
in canonical form, i.e., must be a minimal representative of its
isomorphism class.  Note that the face pairings generated by
\fBtricensus\fR
with option \fB--genpairs\fR all satisfy this condition.
.RE
.PP
This \fBtricensus-manager\fR utility works as follows.
It runs through all files beginning with the given prefix and ending
in \fI.pairs\fR, and assumes each of these contains a
subset of face pairings to process.  If a pairings file has already been
taken by another process (i.e., if a corresponding time file such as
\fI6-or-3.time\fR exists), it will be skipped.
Otherwise the pairings file will be claimed by this process and the
following actions will be taken.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
This process will write its own time file (such as
\fI6-or-3.time\fR) indicating which machine and
which \fBtricensus-manager\fR process has claimed
this particular subset of face pairings.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Command \fBtricensus\fR will be run with this subset
of face pairings to analyse (using option \fB--usepairs\fR).
Any other options given on the \fBtricensus-manager\fR
command-line will be passed directly through to
\fBtricensus\fR (these might include orientability or
minimality options, for instance).  The time at which this
subcensus began will be noted in the time file.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
All output from the running subcensus will be redirected to a
corresponding progress file (such as
\fI6-or-3.progress\fR).  In particular, this allows
the user at any given time to see which face pairings from this
particular subset have been processed.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
When this particular subcensus is complete, the results will be
saved in a corresponding topology data file (such as
\fI6-or-3.rga\fR).  The time at which the subcensus
finished will be noted in the time file.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
At this point \fBtricensus-manager\fR will move on
and look for another subset of face pairings to process.
.PP
Each \fBtricensus-manager\fR process will have at most
one child \fBtricensus\fR process running at any given
time.  Thus, for instance, if you have nine machines (all with
access to the common census directory) and you wish to have two
census calculations running simultaneously on each of these
machines, you should start \fBtricensus-manager\fR
a total of 18 times, twice on each machine, each with an identical
command-line.  These 18 simultaneous processes will then effectively
divide up the overall census between them.
.PP
Option \fB--usepairs\fR need not be given to
\fBtricensus-manager\fR; this will be automatically
supplied to each child \fBtricensus\fR process.
.PP
Note that topology data output filenames must not be given to
\fBtricensus-manager\fR since these differ for each
subcensus.  Topology data filenames will be automatically
derived and supplied to each child \fBtricensus\fR process.
