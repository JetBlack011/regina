.SH NAME
trisetcmp \- Compare triangulations between two Regina data files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtrisetcmp\fR [ \fB-m\fR | \fB-n\fR ] \fB\fIfile1\fB\fR \fB\fIfile2\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility compares all triangulations in the first file against
all triangulations in the second file.  Specifically, it looks to
see which triangulations from \fIfile1\fR are
isomorphic to which triangulations from
\fIfile2\fR\&.
.PP
The two given files must be \fBRegina\fR data files.
A full list of matches (or a full list of non-matches if
\fB-n\fR is passed) is written to standard output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-m (default)\fR
Output matches only.  All isomorphic matches between
triangulations in \fIfile1\fR
and triangulations in \fIfile2\fR
will be listed.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Output non-matches only.  All triangulations from
\fIfile1\fR with no isomorphic match in
\fIfile2\fR will be listed, and vice versa.
