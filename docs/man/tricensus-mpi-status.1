.SH NAME
tricensus-mpi-status \- Summarise the log file of an MPI census of triangulations
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtricensus-mpi-status\fR \fB\fIlog-file\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility reads a log file produced by a
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
job, and writes a human-readable summary to standard output.
It can be used for both jobs that have finished and jobs that are
still running, and it can happily read logs that have been
compressed using \fBgzip\fR or \fBbzip2\fR\&.
.PP
The logs produced by \fBtricensus-mpi\fR are quite
detailed, including timestamps, details of which slaves have taken
which tasks, and how many triangulations each task has produced.
This utility distills this information into an easy-to-read
summary, with one line for each face pairing.
.PP
Output will only be given for face pairings that have been
examined so far (including face pairings whose processing is still
underway), and will include:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
whether processing for each face pairing has
finished;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the number of triangulations found so far for each
face pairing;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the number of subsearches generated and/or finished
for each face pairing (only relevant when running in subsearch
mode).
.PP
The final line of output will list the total number of triangulations
found so far, whether the census has finished, and if not, when the
last log entry was written.
.PP
For further explanation of the terminology used above, see the
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
reference.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
See the
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
reference for a sample session in which
\fBtricensus-mpi-status\fR is used.
