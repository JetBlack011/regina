	<p>
	<b>I cannot start the program at all.  I simply get a message box
	displaying an error concerning the calculation engine.</b>
	<br>
	Regina is split into two components; the Java user interface (which
	the user interacts with directly) and the C++ calculation engine
	(which does all the actual mathematical work).  There are different
	methods by which these two components can communicate.
	<ul>
		<li><b>JNI:</b> The calculation engine is a shared library,
		found on the filesystem of the machine on which you are running
		the user interface.  The user interface loads this shared
		library and calls its routines directly.  This method is the
		default when Regina is run as a standalone application.
		<p>
		If you are using this method, run the <tt>regconf</tt>
		configuration utility and check that the <i>JNI engine
		directory</i> option is set correctly.</li>

		<li><b>CORBA:</b> The calculation engine is a separate
		server application, possibly running on a different machine,
		with which the user interface communicates across the network
		using CORBA.
		This method is the default when Regina is run as an applet on a
		web page.
		<p>
		If you are using this method and are running Regina as a
		standalone application, run the <tt>regconf</tt> configuration
		utility and check that the <i>CORBA engine host</i> and <i>CORBA
		engine port</i> options are set corectly.  If you are using this
		method and are running Regina as an applet on a web page,
		contact the owner of the web page.
		<p>
		You should also ensure that the calculation engine server
		application is running without problems, and is using the same
		host and port settings as those mentioned above for the user
		interface.  Note that the server
		application needs to be started separately.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<b>I ask for help but I am told that JavaHelp and/or the
	documentation jar cannot be found.</b>
	<br>
	The default method for browsing the online documentation uses
	JavaHelp.  JavaHelp is contained in the file <tt>jh.jar</tt> and the
	documentation itself is found in the file <tt>regina-docs.jar</tt>.
	One of these two files cannot be found on your system.  Look in the
	<i>Help-About</i> box for further details regarding what can and
	cannot be found on your system.
	<p>
	Check your configuration to ensure that both these jars are on the
	classpath.  Alternatively, use the <i>Options-Help Browser</i>
	menu item to select your
	favourite web browser instead of JavaHelp.  In this case, the
	documentation should be fully unpacked somewhere on your system.
	Neither of the two aforementioned jars will be required.
	<p>
	And if you are reading this in the help system provided with the
	program and sense some logical flow issues arising, be assured
	that although it took me some time to realise this myself, this page
	is also on the Regina website and thus all is not for naught!

	<p>
	<b>The JPython console buttons/menu items are disabled.  So are the
	Run and Compile buttons in the script editor.</b>
	<br>
	This implies that the JPython classes could not be found.
	Check your configuration to ensure that <tt>jpython.jar</tt>
	is on the classpath.

	<p>
	<b>I cannot edit such-and-such-a packet.  I can view it but I can't
	change anything and there's no Apply button.  Or there is an Apply
	button but it complains if I try to press it.</b>
	<br>
	If a packet has children that need it to remain constant, it will
	become uneditable.  An example is a triangulation that has a normal
	surface list child packet.  The normal surface list stores coordinates
	based upon the triangulation that created it, so the triangulation
	must remain constant or else the coordinates will become invalid.
	<p>
	In such a situation you can try cloning the packet without cloning
	its descendants.  The clone will have no children to worry if it
	changes and so it should be editable.  Alternatively you could
	delete the child packet that is refusing to allow its parent to change.

	<p>
	<b>Something else beyond this rather wanting list of suggestions has
	gone wrong.  Perhaps something crashed.  Maybe the program gave the
	wrong answer.  Or it could be just a little too slow.</b>
	<br>
	Please! - mail me (<a href="mailto:benb@acm.org">benb@acm.org</a>)
	and let me know.  This program is permanently in development.  There
	is a very long to-do list, and chances are your problem is on it.
	And then again chances are it's not.  So please let me know so I am
	sure to know what needs to be fixed/improved.
