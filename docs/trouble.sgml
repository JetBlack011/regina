   <question><para>
    I cannot start the program at all.  I simply get a message box
    displaying an error concerning the calculation engine.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     &regina; is split into two components; the &java; user interface (which
     the user interacts with directly) and the C++ calculation engine
     (which does all the actual mathematical work).  There is currently
     only one method by which these two components can communicate.
    </para>
    <glosslist>
     <glossentry>
      <glossterm>&jni;</glossterm>
      <glossdef><para>
       The calculation engine is a shared library, found on the
       filesystem of the machine on which you are running the user
       interface.  The user interface loads this shared library and calls
       its routines directly.  This method is the default when &regina; is run
       as a standalone application.
       </para><para>
       If you are using this method,
       <link linkend="man-regina.conf">check your configuration</link>
       to ensure that the &jni; engine directory option is set correctly.
      </para></glossdef>

    </glosslist>
    <tip><para>
     If you are running &regina; as a standalone application, using the
     <option>--verbose</option> option will show you the current configuration
     being used.

   <question><para>
    I ask for help but I am told that &javahelp; and/or the documentation
    jar cannot be found.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     The default method for browsing the online documentation uses
     &javahelp; (an embedded &java; help browser).  &javahelp; is
     contained in the file <filename>jh.jar</filename> and the
     documentation itself is found in the file
     <filename>regina-docs.jar</filename>.  One of
     these two jar files could not be found on your system (look in the
     &helpabout; box for further details regarding what can and cannot be
     found on your system).
    </para>
    <para>
     <link linkend="man-regina.conf">Check your configuration</link>
     to ensure that you have the locations of both these jars correct.
     Starting &regina; with the <option>--verbose</option> option will
     show you where it is currently looking for these jars.
    </para>
    <para>
     Alternatively you can use your favourite web browser instead of
     &javahelp;, in which case neither <filename>jh.jar</filename> nor
     <filename>regina-docs.jar</filename> will be required.  See the
     <link linkend="options-help">help browser options reference</link>
     for details.
    </para>
    <para>
     And if you are reading this in the help system provided with the
     program and sense some logical flow issues arising, be assured that
     although it took me some time to realise this myself, this page is
     also on the &regina; website and thus all is not for naught!

   <question><para>
    There are no menu items or buttons to load or save files.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     You are running &regina; as an applet.  This mode does not allow access
     to the local filesystem.
    </para>
    <para>
     Filesystem access for the applet will probably
     never be implemented since &java; applets are designed to run in a
     protected environment without any filesystem access at all.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you wish to be able to load and save files, try running &regina;
     as a standalone application.
     See the <link linkend="man-regina">application command-line
     options</link> for details.

   <question><para>
    The <guimenuitem>Jython Console</guimenuitem>
    buttons/menu items are disabled.  So are the
    <guibutton>Run</guibutton> and <guibutton>Compile</guibutton>
    buttons in the script editor.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     This implies that the &jython; classes could not be found.
     <link linkend="man-regina.conf">Check your configuration</link>
     to ensure that you have the location of <filename>jython.jar</filename>
     correct.
     If you start &regina; with the <option>--verbose</option> option, you
     will see where it is currently looking for <filename>jython.jar</filename>.
    </para>
   </answer>
  </qandaentry>
 
  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>
    I cannot edit such-and-such-a packet.  I can view it but I can't change
    anything and there's no <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button.
    Or there is an <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button but it complains
    if I try to press it.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     If a packet has children that need it to remain constant, it will
     become uneditable.  An example is a triangulation that has a normal
     surface list child packet.  The normal surface list stores coordinates
     based upon the triangulation that created it, so the triangulation
     must remain constant or else the coordinates will become invalid.
    </para>
    <para>
     In such a situation you can try cloning the packet without cloning its
     descendants
     (<menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Packet</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Clone</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Exclude Descendants</guimenuitem>
     </menuchoice>).  The clone will have no children to worry if it changes
     and so it should be editable.  Alternatively you could delete the child
     packet that is refusing to allow its parent to change.
    </para>

   <question><para>
    Something else beyond this rather wanting list of suggestions has gone
    wrong.  Perhaps something crashed.  Maybe the program gave the wrong
    answer.  Or it could be just a little too slow.
   </para></question>
   <answer>
    <para>
     Please! - mail me at &regemail; and let me know.  Or even better,
     use the <link linkend="sourceforge">&sourceforge; services</link>
     such as the bug tracking system and mailing lists so that the
     problem you report is publicly archived.
    </para>
    <para>
     This program is permanently in development.  There is a very
     long todo list, and chances are your problem is on it.  And
     then again chances are it's not.  So please let me know so I
     am sure to know what needs to be fixed/improved.
