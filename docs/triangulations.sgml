 <title>Working with Triangulations</title>

 <para>
  Most 3-manifolds in &regina; are represented by
  <firstterm>triangulations</firstterm>.  A triangulation is a
  particular representation of particular 3-manifold, consisting of a
  set of tetrahedra and instructions on how (some of) the faces of these
  tetrahedra are to be glued together in pairs.
 </para>

  <sect2 id="tri-new">
   <title>New Triangulations</title>
   <para>
    The simplest way to create a triangulation is through the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Packet</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Triangulation</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu item, which will create a new triangulation from scratch.  At
    this point, several choices are offered as described below.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="tri-new-empty">
    <title>Empty</title>

    <para>
     This will create a new triangulation with no tetrahedra at all.
     This option is best if you have a triangulation you wish to enter
     in by hand, in which case you can create a new empty triangulation
     and then manually <link linkend="tri-editgluings">add tetrahedra
     and edit face gluings</link>.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tri-new-layered">
    <title>Layered Solid Torus</title>

    <para>
     This will create a new layered solid torus with parameters
     (<replaceable>a</replaceable>, <replaceable>b</replaceable>,
     <replaceable>c</replaceable>) where all three parameters are
     non-negative, coprime and
     <replaceable>a</replaceable>+<replaceable>b</replaceable>=<replaceable>c</replaceable>.
     These three parameters must be provided before the triangulation
     can be created.
    </para>
    <para>
     A <firstterm>layered solid torus</firstterm> is a solid torus built
     by taking a one-tetrahedron solid torus and repeatedly adding
     layers.  A new layer is added by taking a new tetrahedron and
     gluing two of its faces as a square onto the existing torus
     boundary; the remaining two faces of the new tetrahedron then form
     the new torus boundary.  Note that each new layer can be added in
     three different ways (corresponding to the three different two-face
     squares that can be chosen on the torus boundary).  The
     parameters of the layered solid torus represent the ways in which
     the different layers have been added.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tri-new-lens">
    <title>Lens Space</title>

    <para>
     This will create a layered lens space with parameters
     (<replaceable>p</replaceable>, <replaceable>q</replaceable>)
     where both parameters are positive, coprime and
     <replaceable>p</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>q</replaceable>.
     These two parameters must be provided before the triangulation
     can be created.
    </para>
    <para>
     A <firstterm>layered lens space</firstterm> is a lens space built
     by taking two layered solid tori with appropriate parameters and
     gluing them together along their torus boundaries.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tri-new-dehydration">
    <title>Dehydration</title>

    <para>
     This will create the triangulation obtained by rehydrating the
     given dehydration string.
    </para>
    <para>
     A <firstterm>dehydration string</firstterm> is a set of letters such as
     <literal>dadbcccaqhx</literal> containing enough information to
     recreate the triangulation.  Dehydration strings appear in
     census papers such as the
     <link linkend="bib-cuspedcensus">hyperbolic cusped census</link>,
     in which the dehydration format is explicitly described.
    </para>
   </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="tri-imported">
   <title>Imported Triangulations</title>

   <para>
    Triangulations can also be imported into &regina; from a variety of
    foreign file formats.  Importing is done through the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>File</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Import</guisubmenu>
    </menuchoice>
    menu; the individual file formats are described below.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="tri-import-regina">
    <title>&regina; Data File</title>

    <para>
     The contents of a native &regina; data file can be imported.  In
     this case, the packet tree from the imported file will be
     inserted into the packet tree of the current working file.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tri-import-snappea">
    <title>&snappea; Triangulation</title>

    <para>
     A triangulation obtained from &snappea; can be imported.
     The file should be a text file in &snappea;'s triangulation format;
     an example is shown below.

    <title>Dehydrated Triangulation List</title>

    <para>
     A list of <link linkend="tri-new-dehydration">dehydrated
     triangulation strings</link> can be imported.
     The list should be stored in a text file with one triangulation per
     line.  Each line may contain an arbitrary amount of data, but the
     first word of each line should be the dehydrated triangulation
     string.  A sample file is shown below.
