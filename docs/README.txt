Regina Documentation Directory
------------------------------

This directory tree is used for the generation of man pages and
calculation engine documentation for Regina.

The man pages are extracted from the Regina reference manual, which is now
located in ../kdeui/doc/en/ in a manner consistent with KDE applications.

The calculation engine documentation is generated from the extensive
comments in the source code itself.
