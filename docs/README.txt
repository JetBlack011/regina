Regina Documentation Directory
------------------------------

This directory tree is used for the generation of man pages and
calculation engine documentation for Regina.

The man pages are built from the Regina reference manual, which is now
located in ../kdeui/doc/en/.

The calculation engine documentation is built from the extensive
comments in the source code itself.
