Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file describes general highlights of the changes between
    releases.

    For specific details of these changes as well as changes to the API
    for the calculation engine, see CHANGES.txt in the same directory
    as this file.

Version 4.1.3  [ 25 July, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - New "Open Example" menu item for easy access to sample files
          and census data.
        - Allows the choice of text editor component to be configured.
        - Improved handling of keyboard focus.
    Scripting:
        - Operator == behaves more intuitively for mathematical objects.
          A single mathematical object in the calculation engine may
          have several Python wrapper objects.  The usual Python == tests
          whether two wrappers are in fact the same wrapper object; this
          has now been changed to test whether two wrappers wrap the same
          underlying mathematical object.
        - Fixed scripting in the GUI, which was broken under Python 2.3
          (indented blocks were treated as complete after just one line).
          Note that the command-line tool regina-python was never affected.
        - Added a sample Python session illustrating progress reporting.
    Optimisations:
        - Fixed the massive resource drain when editing script
          variables in a very large data file.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed broken scripting in the GUI (see above).
        - Several fixes and workarounds to make Regina work properly
          with the Vim editor component.
        - Tighter handling of read-only mode for packet viewers.

Version 4.1.2  [ 14 June, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - Allows fundamental groups to be further simplified using GAP
          (Groups, Algorithms and Programming).
    Documentation:
        - Expansion of the troubleshooting section, especially with
          regard to building Regina from source.
        - Overhauled the website and README.txt for greater clarity.
        - Included a suggested form for citing Regina.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Better support out of the box for more platforms, specifically
          including Red Hat and Fedora Core (many thanks to Craig
          Macintyre for his patience and assistance with this).
        - Fixed compile error when building against an STL-enabled Qt.
        - More KDE 3.2 compatibility updates.

Version 4.1.1  [ 24 April, 2004 ]

    Usability:
        - Added "What's This?" buttons to main/packet window borders.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed compile error when building against Python 2.3.

Version 4.1  [ 7 March, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - 3-sphere recognition.
        - Full connected sum decomposition for closed orientable
          triangulations.
        - Conversion to 0-efficient triangulations for closed orientable
          3-manifolds.
        - Automated construction of orientable Seifert fibred spaces over
          the sphere with up to three exceptional fibres.
        - Better recognition of small multiple-vertex triangulations.
    Usability:
        - Each packet type now offers its own menu of possible actions,
          e.g., "Triangulation" menu, "Script" menu, etc.
        - Thorough use of "What's This?" help and tooltips across the
          entire user interface.
        - New tip-of-the-day support.
        - Added an index of common tasks to the reference manual.
        - Various other enhancements for improved feedback and ease of use.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed bug in "tricensus --genpairs" that caused empty output files.
        - Updates for compatibility with KDE 3.2.

Version 4.0.1  [ 26 January, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - Better compile-time magic to select the correct --prefix
          automatically and to detect whether the Qt version is sufficient.
        - No longer requires docbook-utils and its complicated
          dependencies (instead Regina ships with pregenerated manpages).
        - Expanded troubleshooting section of the reference manual.

Version 4.0  [ 20 December, 2003 ]

    Features:
        - Normal surface and angle structure enumeration now display
          progress dialogs and can be cancelled partway through.
        - A Python reference (i.e., the documentation for the underlying
          calculation engine) is now available through the Help menu.
        - Improved simplification of group presentations.
        - More clean-ups in the underlying mathematical code.
        - Python users should note that some normal surface properties
          now return an NTriBool instead of 1/-1/0 for true/false/unknown.

Version 3.97  [ 24 November, 2003 ] - Final prerelease for version 4.0.

    Features:
        - Python scripting is once more incorporated into the graphical
          user interface, as it was in the old days of Java.  It can be
          accessed through the Tools menu or through script packets.
          Note that synchronisation between python and the GUI is much
          better than it was in versions 3.2 and below.
        - Implemented census lookup for triangulations, using the
          censuses shipped with Regina as the default set.
        - Added recognition for trivial non-orientable triangulations.
        - Added recognition for central normal surfaces.
        - Can flatten a layered solid torus to a Mobius band (currently
          available only through the Python interface).
        - Many more configuration options are available.
        - Added a Python caveats section to the reference manual.
    Optimisations:
        - More optimisations for non-orientable census creation using
          new face pairing graph results (see math.GT/0307382:v2).
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed some problems with word wrapping and line endings in the
          embedded text editor.
        - Fixed a bug in the updating of tetrahedron labels when a tetrahedron
          is removed from a triangulation.
        - Fixed some of the compile-time ./configure tests which were broken
          on some systems (in particular some redhat-based systems).

Version 3.96  [ 31 October, 2003 ] - Second prerelease for version 4.0.

    Features:
        - Incorporated Turaev-Viro invariants and isomorphism testing
          into the user interface (previously these were available only
          through python scripting).
        - Wrote the final missing pieces of the reference manual.
        - Various clean-ups in the underlying mathematical code.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed a crash when refreshing the triangulation composition tab.
        - Fixed the annoying splitter auto-resize in the main window.

Version 3.95  [ 12 October, 2003 ] - Prerelease for version 4.0.

    User Interface Rewrites:
        - The graphical user interface has been completely rewritten in C++
          using the KDE libraries.  It is much faster and cleaner, and no
          longer relies on Java support.  The user interface can be started
          by running "regina-kde".
        - Python scripting now uses standard Python, not Jython.  The API
          is much closer to that of the C++ calculation engine and
          everything has been moved into the single module "regina".
          A python session can be started by running "regina-python".
    Features:
        - Better and more consistent support for recognising standard
          triangulations and their underlying 3-manifolds.
        - Calculates Turaev-Viro invariants of triangulations.
        - Finds isomorphic copies of bounded triangulations within
          larger triangulations.
        - External objects can now be automatically notified of changes
          to packets and packet trees.

Version 3.2  [ 22 June, 2003 ] - The post-thesis release!

    Features:
        - Layered loops can be automatically constructed.
        - Much better recognition of common names for Seifert fibred spaces.
        - New utility regconcat for merging data files.
    Optimisations:
        - Significant performance increase for census generation, especially
          in the non-orientable case, due to the use of results regarding
          face pairing graphs.
        - Significant performance increase for 0-efficiency calculation,
          obtained by using quad space where possible.
    Miscellaneous:
        - Added closed orientable census, closed non-orientable census
          and splitting surface signature census to example files.
        - File format is fully documented in the reference manual.
        - Calculation engine test suite much enhanced.
        - PhD thesis submitted on 30 May, 2003!

Version 3.1  [ 18 October, 2002 ]

    - Massive optimisation of census code.
    - Strong optimisation of normal surface enumeration code.
    - Census calculations can be split into independent pieces (e.g., for
      running on different machines).
    - Triangulation simplification improved, including random 4-4 moves.
    - Offers more common names for recognised Seifert fibred spaces.
    - Supports multiple vertex enumeration engines (though no new
      engines are added yet).
    - Jython consoles start with variable [selected] set to the currently
      selected packet.
    - Fixed ideal-to-finite bug that was introduced in Regina 3.0.
    - New calculation engine test suite (currently fairly small).
    - New autoconf/automake/libtool build system.

Version 3.0  [ 28 June, 2002 ] - The "XML, about bloody time" release.

    - Moved from old impenetrable binary data files to new compressed
      XML data files.
    - Works with splitting surface signatures.
    - Yet more subcomplex recognition.
    - Recognises thin edge links.
    - Supports arbitrary packet tags.
    - Optimisations for skeletal calculations in triangulations.
    - Introduced various command-line utility programs.
    - Reference manual much enhanced.
    - The Great STL Port: calculation engine completely reworked to use
      and play well with the C++ Standard Template Library.  Also made
      more standards-compliant (i.e., compiles under gcc3) and put in
      its own namespace (regina).
    - Removed CORBA engine/interface (see CHANGES.txt for why).
    - Happy birthday to me!

Version 2.3  [ 12 December, 2001 ] - The "Farewell Stillwater" release.

    - Recognises more families of subcomplexes in a triangulation
      (layered chain, layered loop, lens space, Seifert fibred space,
      triangular / spiralled / augmented triangular solid torus).
    - Recognises specific face types in a triangulation.
    - Crushes normal surfaces to a point.
    - More triangulation properties (0-efficient, has splitting surface).
    - More normal surface properties (connectedness, vertex link,
      splitting surface, 2-sided).
    - 4-4 moves can be performed on a triangulation.
    - Imports and exports Regina files and scripts.
    - Jython scripting behaves more naturally.
    - Loading/saving files works even through a remote CORBA engine.
    - Builds calculation engine as a shared library to link into other
      programs.
    - Various bug fixes.
