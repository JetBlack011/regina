Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file describes general highlights of the changes between
    releases.

    For specific details of these changes as well as changes to the API
    for both the calculation engine and the Java user interface, see
    CHANGES.txt in the same directory as this file.

Version 3.1  [ 18 October, 2002 ]

    - Massive optimisation of census code.
    - Strong optimisation of normal surface enumeration code.
    - Census calculations can be split into independent pieces (e.g., for
      running on different machines).
    - Triangulation simplification improved, including random 4-4 moves.
    - Offers more common names for recognised Seifert fibred spaces.
    - Supports multiple vertex enumeration engines (though no new
      engines are added yet).
    - Jython consoles start with variable [selected] set to the currently
      selected packet.
    - Fixed ideal-to-finite bug that was introduced in Regina 3.0.
    - New calculation engine test suite (currently fairly small).
    - New autoconf/automake/libtool build system.

Version 3.0  [ 28 June, 2002 ] - The "XML, about bloody time" release.

    - Moved from old impenetrable binary data files to new compressed
      XML data files.
    - Works with splitting surface signatures.
    - Yet more subcomplex recognition.
    - Recognises thin edge links.
    - Supports arbitrary packet tags.
    - Optimisations for skeletal calculations in triangulations.
    - Introduced various command-line utility programs.
    - Reference manual much enhanced.
    - The Great STL Port: calculation engine completely reworked to use
      and play well with the C++ Standard Template Library.  Also made
      more standards-compliant (i.e., compiles under gcc3) and put in
      its own namespace (regina).
    - Removed CORBA engine/interface (see CHANGES.txt for why).
    - Happy birthday to me!

Version 2.4  [ 4 April, 2002 ]

    - Calculates vertex angle structures.
    - Rehydrates dehydrated triangulation strings.
    - Calculates double covers.
    - Exports SnapPea files.
    - Creates layered lens spaces with fewest possible tetrahedra.
    - Individual normal surfaces may be named.
    - Filenames may be specified on the command-line.
    - Text consoles have readline/editline support.
    - More keyboard accelerators.
    - Added SnapPea census and knot/link census to examples.
    - Added directory of prepackaged Jython libraries.
    - Option REGINA_OPTIONS_GLOBAL is guessed more intelligently.
    - Much enhanced documentation.

Version 2.3  [ 12 December, 2001 ] - The "Farewell Stillwater" release.

    - Recognises more families of subcomplexes in a triangulation
      (layered chain, layered loop, lens space, Seifert fibred space,
      triangular / spiralled / augmented triangular solid torus).
    - Recognises specific face types in a triangulation.
    - Crushes normal surfaces to a point.
    - More triangulation properties (0-efficient, has splitting surface).
    - More normal surface properties (connectedness, vertex link,
      splitting surface, 2-sided).
    - 4-4 moves can be performed on a triangulation.
    - Imports and exports Regina files and scripts.
    - Jython scripting behaves more naturally.
    - Loading/saving files works even through a remote CORBA engine.
    - Builds calculation engine as a shared library to link into other
      programs.
    - Various bug fixes.

Version 2.2  [ 7 October, 2001 ]

    (See CHANGES.txt for details beyond this point.)
