Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file describes general highlights of the changes between
    releases.

    For specific details of these changes as well as changes to the API
    for both the calculation engine and the Java user interface, see
    CHANGES.txt in the same directory as this file.

Version 2.3.1  [ (in progress) ]

    - Works with angle structures.
    - Exports SnapPea files.
    - Rehydrates dehydrated triangulation strings.
    - Individual normal surfaces may be named.
    - Filenames may be specified on the command-line.
    - Text consoles have readline/editline support.
    - More keyboard accelerators.
    - Added SnapPea census and knot/link census to examples.
    - Added directory of prepackaged Jython libraries.
    - Option REGINA_OPTIONS_GLOBAL is guessed more intelligently.
    - Much enhanced documentation.
    
Version 2.3  [ 12 December, 2001 ] - The "Farewell Stillwater" release.

    - Recognises more families of subcomplexes in a triangulation
      (layered chain, layered loop, lens space, Seifert fibred space,
      triangular / spiralled / augmented triangular solid torus).
    - Recognises specific face types in a triangulation.
    - Crushes normal surfaces to a point.
    - More triangulation properties (0-efficient, has splitting surface).
    - More normal surface properties (connectedness, vertex link,
      splitting surface, 2-sided).
    - 4-4 moves can be performed on a triangulation.
    - Imports and exports Regina files and scripts.
    - Jython scripting behaves more naturally.
    - Loading/saving files works even through a remote CORBA engine.
    - Builds calculation engine as a shared library to link into other
      programs.
    - Various bug fixes.

Version 2.2  [ 7 October, 2001 ]

    (See CHANGES.txt for details beyond this point.)
