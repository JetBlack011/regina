Regina Scripts Directory
------------------------

This directory contains script components used by the Regina startup script.

Nothing in this directory should actually be run directly.

To start Regina, use the main startup script found in ../../bin.

This startup script is probably called "regina", although on some systems
it is called "regina-normal" so as not to conflict with the Regina REXX
interpreter.
