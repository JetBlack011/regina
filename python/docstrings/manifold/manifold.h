// Docstring regina::python::doc::Manifold_::__cmp
static const char *__cmp =
R"doc(Compares representations of two 3-manifolds according to an aesthetic
ordering.

The only purpose of this routine is to implement a consistent ordering
of 3-manifold representations. The specific ordering used is purely
aesthetic on the part of the author, and is subject to change in
future versions of Regina.

It does not matter whether the two 3-manifolds are homeomorphic; this
routine compares the specific _representations_ of these manifolds
(and so in particular, different representations of the same
3-manifold might well be ordered differently).

This operator generates all of the usual comparison operators,
including ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, and ``>=``.

.. warning::
    Currently this routine is only implemented in full for closed
    3-manifolds. For most classes of bounded 3-manifolds, this routine
    simply compares the strings returned by name(). For this reason,
    the return value is currently marked as a weak ordering, since it
    is possible that different representations of the same 3-manifold
    will produce the same string name.

Python:
    This spaceship operator ``x <=> y`` is not available, but the
    other comparison operators that it generates _are_ available.

Parameter ``rhs``:
    the 3-manifold representation to compare this with.

Returns:
    A result that indicates how this and the given 3-manifold
    representation should be ordered with respect to each other.)doc";

been implemented. For details of which types of 3-manifolds have
implemented this routine, see the class notes for each corresponding
subclasses of Manifold.

The default implemention of this routine just throws a NotImplemented
exception.

Exception ``NotImplemented``:
    Explicit construction has not yet been implemented for this
    particular 3-manifold.

Exception ``FileError``:
    The construction needs to be read from file (as opposed to
    computed on the fly), but the file is inaccessible or its contents
    cannot be read and parsed correctly. Currently this can only
    happen for the subclass SnapPeaCensusManifold, which reads its
    triangulations from the SnapPea census databases that are
    installed with Regina.

Returns:
    a triangulation of this 3-manifold, if this construction has been
    implemented.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Manifold_::homology
static const char *homology =

The default implemention of this routine just throws a NotImplemented
exception.

Exception ``NotImplemented``:
    Homology calculation has not yet been implemented for this
    particular 3-manifold.

Exception ``FileError``:
    The homology needs to be read from file (as opposed to computed),

evident from its common name. For instance, for an orbit space SÂ³/G
this routine might return the full Seifert structure.
