# Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator
# Python Test Suite Runner
#
# Copyright (c) 2007-2022, Ben Burton
# For further details contact Ben Burton (bab@debian.org).
#
# Usage: testbasic
#
# Runs most but not all of the Python test suite using a basic C++ executable
# with an embedded Python interpreter and an in-built timeout feature.
#
# Like testall, this script works through all *.test files in or beneath
# the current directory; however, unlike testall it skips those tests
# whose names are in a hard-coded blacklist.  Similar to testall, this
# script runs each test through the basic embedded Python interpreter and
# compares the results byte-by-byte with the corresponding *.out files.
# Any mismatches or timeouts are considered to be test failures.
#
# This script MUST be run from the python/testsuite directory in the
# build tree.  It runs everything directly out of the build tree.
# It does not require regina to be installed on the system (and indeed
# it ignores any installation that it might find).
#
# Unlike testall, the corresponding python/testsuite directory will *not*
# be passed to the test scripts.  Any scripts that require this information
# should not be used with testbasic.
