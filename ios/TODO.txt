CLEAN UP:

- MasterViewController
- WelcomePopupController
- PacketTreeController
- ReginaDocument
- NewPacketMenu
- NewPacketController
- NewPacketPageViewController

- DetailViewController
- PacketViewController
- PacketSubcontroller

- PacketManagerIOS

- packets/TriangulationViewController
- packets/TriangulationSubcontroller
- packets/TriGluingsViewController
- packets/TriRecognitionViewController

- packets/NewAnglesController

WRITE VIEWERS:

- PDF:                    one-page
- 2-D triangulation:      tabs,     editor
- 3-D triangulation:      tabs,     editor
- SnapPea triangulation:  tabs,     editor
- Normal surfaces:        tabs

TEST:

- Dim2 creation from surface page, once we have a proper Dim2 viewer.
- Return to the app during facetime (status bar is thicker), and make sure
  the UI is still laid out correctly.

LONG-TERM:

- Call UIApplication::idleTimerDisabled when running long tasks
  (e.g., enumerating normal surfaces), to stop the screen from locking.
- Find a way to install *.tdb in a subdirectory beneath Resources/.
- Rename actions: tap outside the text field -> end edit
- Rename actions: ensure table view insets are OK if the device is rotated while the keyboard is shown
- Audit the use of UIAlert (should we use banners instead)?

- Support state preservation and restoration.  See:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/StatePreservation/StatePreservation.html

- iCloud:
  + Support, including moving files to/from iCloud storage.
  + Indicate error conditions and handle document-version conflicts.
  + All documents in iCloud or none.  See: https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/ManageDocumentLifeCycle/ManageDocumentLifeCycle.html
