WRITE VIEWERS:

- 2-D triangulation
- 3-D triangulation
- SnapPea triangulation
- Normal surfaces
- Angle structures
- Filters
- Script

WRITE EDITORS:

- 2-D triangulation
- 3-D triangulation
- SnapPea triangulation
- Filters
- Text

WRITE CREATORS:

Instant:
  - SnapPea triangulation
  - Filter

Algorithmic:
  - Normal surfaces (check what's there now)
  - Angle structures

TEST:

- Dim2 creation from surface page, once we have a proper Dim2 viewer.

SHORT-TERM:

- Cut down the iOS census examples to a faster-to-load size.

- Call UIApplication::idleTimerDisabled when running long tasks (e.g.,
  enumerating normal surfaces), to stop the screen from locking.


UI TESTS:

Return to the app during facetime (status bar is thicker), and make sure
the UI is still laid out correctly.

LONG-TERM:

Restore arm64 build (0ed85f0).
Find a way to install *.tdb in a subdirectory beneath Resources/.
iCloud:
- Support, including moving files to/from iCloud storage.
- Indicate error conditions and handle document-version conflicts.
- All documents in iCloud or none.  See: https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/ManageDocumentLifeCycle/ManageDocumentLifeCycle.html
