- WelcomePopupController
- PacketTreeController
- ReginaDocument
- NewPacketMenu
- NewPacketController

WRITE VIEWERS:

- SnapPea triangulation
- Normal surfaces
- Angle structures
- Filters
- Script

WRITE EDITORS:

- 2-D triangulation
- 3-D triangulation
- SnapPea triangulation
- Filters
- Text

TEST:

- Dim2 creation from surface page, once we have a proper Dim2 viewer.

SHORT-TERM:

- Doucments + : disallow a second press.

- Open bad file in dropbox: fails.

- Audit the use of UIAlert (should we use banners instead)?

- Cut down the iOS census examples to a faster-to-load size.

- Call UIApplication::idleTimerDisabled when running long tasks (e.g.,
  enumerating normal surfaces), to stop the screen from locking.


UI TESTS:

Return to the app during facetime (status bar is thicker), and make sure
the UI is still laid out correctly.

LONG-TERM:

Restore arm64 build (0ed85f0).
Find a way to install *.tdb in a subdirectory beneath Resources/.
Rename actions: tap outside the text field -> end edit
Rename actions: ensure table view insets are OK if the device is rotated while the keyboard is shown
