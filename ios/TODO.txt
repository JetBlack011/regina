SHORT-TERM:

Open in portrait: Documents link is missing.

- Call UIApplication::idleTimerDisabled when running long tasks (e.g.,
  enumerating normal surfaces), to stop the screen from locking.


UI TESTS:

Return to the app during facetime (status bar is thicker), and make sure
the UI is still laid out correctly.



LONG-TERM:

Restore arm64 build (0ed85f0).
Find a way to install *.tdb in a subdirectory beneath Resources/.
