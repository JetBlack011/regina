Regina Image Source Directory
-----------------------------

This directory tree contains files used in the construction of the
various images and icons for Regina.  If images need to be modified
or reproduced in a new size, the files in this directory tree are
generally the best starting point.

Due to their size, these files are not shipped with the Regina source
distribution.  If you wish to use them, you will need to check them out
of CVS.

As an exception, the povray sources for Regina's title icon are shipped
with the Regina sources (since they are simple text files).  They may be
found in the directory regina-<version>/icons/povray/ .


ATTRIBUTIONS:

The packet_pdf icon is based on the pdf mimetype icon shipped with kdelibs.
