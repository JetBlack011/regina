    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Reads Regina options from directory $REGINA_OPTIONS_LOCAL
              and reads runtime options from system properties (which

            - Dynamically finds JavaHelp classes so JavaHelp is not
              necessary for compilation.
            - Cleanly handles missing runtime options file.

        normal.algorithm:
            - Added class ElementaryMove.
        normal.console:
            - Major rearrangements; new class JPythonUtils now does most of
              the Jython work.
        normal.console.JPythonConsoleFrame:
            - Stores the root of the associated packet tree.
            - Allows saving the contents of the console to a file.
        normal.engine.implementation.corba.CORBAEngine:
            - Better error handling.
        normal.mainui:
            - Renamed SystemPane to TopologyPane and moved generic file
              editing functionality into FilePane to allow for editing
              different file types.
            - Much all-round cleaning up.
        normal.mainui.LibraryPane:
            - New class; allows editing of Jython libraries.
        normal.mainui.NormalFrame:
            - Moved console ownership routines into normal.Shell.
            - More appropriate enabling/disabling of menu items and buttons.
            - Edit menu hooks into current working file.
        normal.mainui.TopologyPane:
            - Closing a file closes all associated consoles.
            - Fixed the bug where double clicking on a tree item opens
              it three times.
            - Fixed bugs in the various fire... routines.
            - Improved interaction with the packet rename dialog.
            - Fixed the packet renaming bug in the visual tree display.
        normal.mainui.PacketTreeNode:
            - Replaced insertUnwrappedDescendants() with
              verifyDescendants() which actually does what it should; thus
              the refresh button now works properly.
            - Added findChildNodeIndex().
        normal.packetui.PacketUI:
            - Added subtreeWasDeleted().
        normal.packetui.packet.NContainerViewer:

            - Pulled SkeletonTableFrame out into its own standalone class
              and turned it into a dialog.
        normal.packetui.triangulation.NTriangulationEditor:
            - Added triangulation component recognition.

Version 2.1.1a  [ 8 March, 2001 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Set up system for creating distributions.
        - Final tidying up for proper release.

Version 2.1.1
    OVERALL:
        - Added a CORBA interface to the engine.
        - Rearranged Makefiles and directory structure for CVS and
          SourceForge.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Split config.h into config.h and regina.h.
        Class Engine:
            - Formalised and slightly rearranged.
            - Added getVersion...() routines.
        Class NBoolSet:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
              Added getByteCode(), setByteCode() and fromByteCode() for
              this purpose.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Added coordinate system FACE_ARCS; renumbered EDGE_WEIGHT.
        Class NPerm:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added routine isStandard().
    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Allows running as an applet as well as an application.
            - Class normal.Application now contains just global constants
              and a generic applet/application shell.  Class normal.Shell
              contains top-level Regina runtime routines and routines
              specific to the shell type (applet or application).
            - Made miscellaneous optimisations.
        normal.packetui.census.NCensusCreator:
            - Altered the boundary combo box strings to avoid
              misinterpretation.
        normal.packetui.surfaces.NSurfaceFilterEditor:
            - Fixed the bug in which changes in the filter were not
              always being immediately reflected in the surface list.

Version 2.1.0  [ 18 December, 2000 ]
