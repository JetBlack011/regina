Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    OVERALL:
        - Ported CORBA stuff to omniORB3.
        - Tightened up runtime scripts.
        - Tidied up Makefiles and CVS.
        - Moved options files to $REGINA_OPTIONS.

Version 2.1.1a
    OVERALL:
        - Set up system for creating distributions.
        - Final tidying up for proper release.

Version 2.1.1
    OVERALL:
        - Added a CORBA interface to the engine.
        - Rearranged Makefiles and directory structure for CVS and
          SourceForge.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Split config.h into config.h and regina.h.
        Class Engine:
            - Formalised and slightly rearranged.
            - Added getVersion...() routines.
        Class NBoolSet:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
              Added getByteCode(), setByteCode() and fromByteCode() for
              this purpose.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Added coordinate system FACE_ARCS; renumbered EDGE_WEIGHT.
        Class NPerm:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added routine isStandard().
    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Allows running as an applet as well as an application.
            - Class normal.Application now contains just global constants
              and a generic applet/application shell.  Class normal.Shell
              contains top-level Regina runtime routines and routines
              specific to the shell type (applet or application).
            - Made miscellaneous optimisations.
        normal.packetui.census.NCensusCreator:
            - Altered the boundary combo box strings to avoid
              misinterpretation.
        normal.packetui.surfaces.NSurfaceFilterEditor:
            - Fixed the bug in which changes in the filter were not
              always being immediately reflected in the surface list.

Version 2.1.0
