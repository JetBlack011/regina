Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    OVERALL:
        - Builds and runs under windows!
        - Tightened up runtime scripts.
        - Tidied up Makefiles and CVS.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Ported CORBA stuff to omniORB3.
        Class NDoubleList, NDynamicArray:
            - Added operator = to the iterator classes.
        Class NGroupExpression, NGroupPresentation:
            - New classes.
        Class NPacket:
            - Changed meaning of second (boolean) parameter to clone().
            - Added getNumberOfDescendants() and getNumberOfChildren();
              renamed totalTreeSize() to getTotalTreeSize().
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added fundamental group as a new property.
            - Added a two-zero move about a vertex.
    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Moved options files to $REGINA_OPTIONS.
            - Ported from JPython 1.1 to Jython 2.1-alpha1.
            - Now supports custom Jython libraries.
            - Improved support for mnemonics and keyboard accelerators.
            - Fixed tooltips in tables.
        normal.console:
            - Major rearrangements; new class JPythonUtils now does most of
              the Jython work.
        normal.console.JPythonConsoleFrame:
            - Allows saving the contents of the console to a file.
        normal.mainui.SystemPane:
            - Fixed the bug where double clicking on a tree item opens
              it three times.
            - Fixed bugs in the various fire... routines.
            - Improved interaction with the packet rename dialog.
        normal.mainui.PacketTreeNode:
            - Replaced insertUnwrappedDescendants() with
              verifyDescendants() which actually does what it should; thus
              the refresh button now works properly.
            - Added findChildNodeIndex().
        normal.packetui.PacketUI:
            - Added subtreeWasDeleted().
        normal.packetui.packet.NContainerViewer:
            - Displays tree size statistics.

Version 2.1.1a
    OVERALL:
        - Set up system for creating distributions.
        - Final tidying up for proper release.

Version 2.1.1
    OVERALL:
        - Added a CORBA interface to the engine.
        - Rearranged Makefiles and directory structure for CVS and
          SourceForge.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Split config.h into config.h and regina.h.
        Class Engine:
            - Formalised and slightly rearranged.
            - Added getVersion...() routines.
        Class NBoolSet:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
              Added getByteCode(), setByteCode() and fromByteCode() for
              this purpose.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Added coordinate system FACE_ARCS; renumbered EDGE_WEIGHT.
        Class NPerm:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added routine isStandard().
    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Allows running as an applet as well as an application.
            - Class normal.Application now contains just global constants
              and a generic applet/application shell.  Class normal.Shell
              contains top-level Regina runtime routines and routines
              specific to the shell type (applet or application).
            - Made miscellaneous optimisations.
        normal.packetui.census.NCensusCreator:
            - Altered the boundary combo box strings to avoid
              misinterpretation.
        normal.packetui.surfaces.NSurfaceFilterEditor:
            - Fixed the bug in which changes in the filter were not
              always being immediately reflected in the surface list.
