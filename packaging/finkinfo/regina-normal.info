DescPackaging: <<
Although the upstream application is called regina, this package is called
regina-normal to avoid confusion with regina the REXX interpreter.
.
Regarding shared libraries:  Regina builds one shared library
(libregina-engine), plus one dlopenable python module.
.
The library libregina-engine is designed for external use.  The library is
shipped in the splitoff regina-normal%v-shlibs, and headers and symlinks
are shipped in the splitoff regina-normal%v-dev.  The library API changes
significantly with each release, and so the upstream version number is
part of the soname (and therefore part of the -shlibs package name).
.
Regarding cppunit:  If the cppunit development files are installed at build
time, they will be used to build and run the C++ test suite.  This is merely
for extra sanity testing however, and the final .debs will be the same
whether cppunit is installed or not.

DescDetail: <<
Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
It focuses upon the study of 3-manifold triangulations and includes
support for normal surfaces and angle structures.
.
Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
Python scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
.
This package includes the KDE user interface and the command-line
Python interface, as well as the users' reference manual and the
Python reference (i.e., the API documentation for the Regina
calculation engine).
<<
DescUsage: <<
Two main binaries are provided with Regina:
.
- %p/bin/regina-kde, which starts the KDE user interface;
- %p/bin/regina-python, which starts a command-line Python session.
.
Several other specialised binaries are also provided; see the users'
reference manual for details.
.
The users' reference manual is provided with this package and can be
viewed in the KDE Help Centre, or by entering the URL 'help:/regina/'
directly into konqueror.  It can also be viewed through Regina's graphical
user interface by selecting "Help -> Regina Handbook".
.
Sample topology data files and sample Python sessions are provided in
the directory %p/share/doc/regina-normal/examples/.
.
If you are using Python scripting or if you are building the Regina
calculation engine into your own projects, you will probably want the
calculation engine API documentation.  This API documentation is
installed in the directory %p/share/regina-normal/engine-docs/, and
can also be viewed through Regina's graphical user interface by selecting
"Help -> Python Reference".
.
Headers and other development files required for building Regina's C++
calculation engine into your own projects are provided by the package
regina-normal%v-dev.
.
If you find Regina useful in your research, please consider citing it as
you would any other paper that you use.  The introductory chapter of the
Regina reference manual includes a suggested form of reference.
