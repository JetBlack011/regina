Regina Local MPI Utilities Directory
------------------------------------

As with the parent directory regina/utils/local/, this directory
contains miscellaneous command-line utilities that are not intended for
final installation.  The utilities in this subdirectory also make use of
MPI (the Message Passing Interface, used for parallel computation).

Like the utilities in the parent directory regina/utils/local/, these
are not built by default and are not included in binary packages for
Regina.  See the README.txt file in the parent directory for further
information.
