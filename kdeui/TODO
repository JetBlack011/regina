KDE User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

No proper TODO list will be kept for the KDE UI until it reaches a somewhat
usable state.

Icons:
	Softer borders for regina.png
	Softer tree for filter_comb.png
	Icons for separate New actions

Toolbars:
	Disable "configure toolbars" until delayed icon loading is fixed in
		kdelibs
	Work out how on earth to get file_close on the toolbar
	Work out how to get decent action names in the configure toolbar dialog

General:
	Make "configure shortcuts" work with the part as well
