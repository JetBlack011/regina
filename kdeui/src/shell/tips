Each piece of information stored in a topology data file is called a
<i>packet</i>.  There are many different types of packets: containers,
triangulations, normal surface lists, text items and more.
<p>
Packets are arranged in a tree (displayed on the left hand side of the
main window), so each packet may &lquot;contain&rquot; several other
packets.  This allows you to store large amounts of data in an organised
fashion.

<p>
Each time a packet is opened in the main window, the <i>Docked
Packet</i> menu is filled with actions appropriate to the packet type.
<p>
For instance, when a triangulation is opened, the <i>Docked Packet</i>
menu contains actions such as barycentric subdivision and connected sum
decomposition.
