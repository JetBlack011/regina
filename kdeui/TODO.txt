KDE User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

Icons:
    Softer borders for regina.png
    Softer tree for filter_comb.png
    Icons for separate New actions

Toolbars / Menus:
    Disable "configure toolbars" until delayed icon loading is fixed in
        kdelibs
    Work out how to get decent action names in the configure toolbar dialog
    Work out how to right align the close button in the packet viewer

General:
    Make "configure shortcuts" work with the part as well
    Enhance the DCOP interface.
