KDE User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

* means must be implemented in the next release.
+ means would be nice to have implemented in the next release.
- means would be pleasant to have some time.

General:
    - Make "configure shortcuts" work with the part as well as with the shell
    - Enhance the DCOP interface
    * Observing some serious problems with vimpart, as well as with
        katepart word wrapping.

Census:
    - Implement GUI census creation
    * Include closed hyperbolic census
    * More explicit references for the Regina-generated censuses

Containers:
    - Update container viewers whenever their subtrees change, not just when
        their immediate children change

Docs:
    + Include a walk-through
    + More sample python sessions

Icons:
    - Softer tree for filter_comb.png
    - Icons for separate New actions
    - Separate mimetype icon set

Import/Export:
    - Allow a greater variety of dehydration list file formats

Packets (General):
    - Implement packet tags
    - Work out how to right-align the packet pane close button
    - Find out how to centre column headers in list views
    * If a packet viewer is opened read-write and then obtains a bad
        child, ensure we cannot subsequently modify it


Part:
    - Fix crash on "import regina" when running scripts from within
        a konqueror embedded preview
    - Fix missing help icon when running scripts from within a konqueror
        embedded preview
    * A read-only katepart never gets filled with text, whereas a
        read-only vimpart can in fact be edited (but not committed)

Python:
    - Allow breaking processing in python consoles
    - Check to see whether user libraries are in fact text files
    - Allow compilation and running of open libraries
    * Something nasty with the python console & looping

Scripts:
    - Make a script dirty when its variables are changed externally
        through renaming or deletion
    - Packet choosers with very large files seem to cause real problems
        (e.g., variable table for snappea census)

Toolbars:
    - Disable "configure toolbars" until delayed icon loading is fixed in
        kdelibs
    - Work out how to get decent action names in the configure toolbar dialog

Triangulations:
    - Make the skeleton viewer windows appear in a pleasant size
    + Only fill the isomorphism combo box when absolutely necessary

Website:
    * More detailed citations for census data on the website
