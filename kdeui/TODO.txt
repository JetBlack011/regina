KDE User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

General:
    Make "configure shortcuts" work with the part as well as with the shell
    More "What's This?" texts, including a what's this button on the toolbar
    Enhance the DCOP interface

Census:
    Implement GUI census creation

Containers:
    Update container viewers whenever their subtrees change, not just when
        their immediate children change

Icons:
    Softer tree for filter_comb.png
    Icons for separate New actions
    Icon for barycentric subdivision
    Separate mimetype icon set

Import/Export:
    Allow a greater variety of dehydration list file formats

Packets (General):
    Implement packet tags
    Work out how to right-align the packet pane close button
    Work around Vim component bugs in script/text viewers
    Find out how to centre column headers in list views
    Change the "Docked Packet" menu title according to packet type

Python:
    Allow breaking processing in python consoles
    Check to see whether user libraries are in fact text files
    Allow compilation and running of open libraries
    Fix crash on "import regina" when running scripts from within
        a konqueror embedded preview
    Fix missing help icon when running scripts from within a konqueror
        embedded preview

Scripts:
    Make a script dirty when its variables are changed externally
        through renaming or deletion
    Packet choosers with very large files seem to cause real problems
        (e.g., variable table for snappea census)

Toolbars:
    Disable "configure toolbars" until delayed icon loading is fixed in
        kdelibs
    Work out how to get decent action names in the configure toolbar dialog

Triangulations:
    Make the skeleton viewer windows appear in a pleasant size
    Only fill the isomorphism combo box when absolutely necessary
    UI hooks for 3-sphere recognition and "make 0-efficient".
