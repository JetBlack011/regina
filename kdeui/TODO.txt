KDE User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

Note that this TODO list pertains only to the user interface; there is
also a calculation engine TODO list found under "Related Pages" in the
engine documentation.

Icons:
    Softer borders for regina.png
    Softer tree for filter_comb.png
    Icons for separate New actions

Toolbars:
    Disable "configure toolbars" until delayed icon loading is fixed in
        kdelibs
    Work out how on earth to get file_close on the toolbar
    Work out how to get decent action names in the configure toolbar dialog

General:
    Make "configure shortcuts" work with the part as well
