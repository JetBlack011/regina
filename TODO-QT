Clean-up:
- Check that window-close is handled in GAPRunner and PatienceDialog.
- GAPRunner: Fix QDialogButtonBox usage; broken cancel on error.
- Linux: Check that we call QWidget::setWindowIcon() for top-level windows.

Appearance:
- Reorganise the Preferences dialog.

Unimplemented:
- Census prefs: system files different; display sensible names during lookup

Commit / discard redesign:
- Get rid of the commit/discard mechanism, which is counterintuitive.
- Simultaneous edits, choose commit (not external) -> not propagated.

Packet pane / dock redesign:
- The dock/undock mechanism is very broken.
- Rejuvenate the PacketPane header, including FlatButton & hard-coded 22px icon
- Open a new file by default, and give the root-level container a better name.
- Undocked panes: cut/copy/paste commented but still works; is a menu missing?

Edit menu:
- Python console: Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in code?
- Undo/Redo: "works" in regular text/script editors but nowhere else.

Low-priority:
- MacOS: Include graphviz in the bundle.
- Reimplement tip of the day (not supported out-of-the-box by Qt).
