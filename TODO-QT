Unicode (e.g. Poincare homology sphere in create-triangulation)
Hunt for instances of pixmap(..,..).

Lock icon on trianglations with surface lists

The toolbar is fairly bulky: make it 22x22, not 32x32.

CMakeLists:
- restore GUI documentation (which was built using meinproc);
- install application icons and Desktop files for KDE/GNOME;
- install mimetype handling for KDE/GNOME.

Check that we call QWidget::setWindowIcon() for top-level windows.

Install desktop files and icons for KDE/GNOME:

Mimetype installation on linux desktops

Icons: Most icons (essentially, any Regina-specific icons and any that I
couldn't find a reasonable equivalent in
http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html
are blank. There are some options here, including 
a) Pointing regina to the right folder (OS-specific)
b) Bundling the resources into the executable (OS-agnostic)
c) Finding appropriate system-default-installed icons

Help->About doesn't list authors/contributors. This is just a matter of
creating it, I can do it but wanted to get it all running so you can
have a look at it.
warnOnNonEmbedded - when enumerating non-embedded surfaces, the dialog
currently has no "Don't warn me again" option. This'll have to be
recreated manually, and we need to pass the value back to ReginaPrefSet
somehow.

Recent files option in the File Menu. As best I found, Qt doesn't offer
this itself, but there's an example at
http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/mainwindows-recentfiles.html

Links to documentation are still wrong/not set up. Need to add/use some
regina (the library/engine) option/setting to get the correct path.

Tip of the day is missing, again Qt doesn't offer anything that does
this as best I can tell.
Mime-type checking, Qt doesn't offer this.
Help button/system for the preferences window.

Undo/Redo actions. This "works" in regular text editor (and script
editor) but nowhere else.

File encoding : imports/exports currently don't do anything about
different file encodings

Python console - Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in
code?

Session management : Currently this doesn't happen at all, can be
implemented if needed.

Undocked packet windows : cut/copy/paste have been commented, but as
best I can tell they still work. Is there a menu missing here?

Script editor : Syntax highlighting
