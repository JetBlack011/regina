Packet pane / dock redesign:
- The dock/undock mechanism is very broken.

Edit menu:
- Python console: Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in code?
- Undocked panes: cut/copy/paste commented but still works; is a menu missing?
- Undo/Redo: "works" in regular text/script editors but nowhere else.

Low-priority:
- MacOS: Include graphviz in the bundle.

Stephan:
- Document NNormalSurface::boundarySlopes().
- Merge and clean up TONS.

Misc:
- Incorporate fundamental normal surfaces into the UI.
- Windows: Work out what to do with ~/.regina-libs
- Windows: View PDF packet breaks (Adobe says cannot open)
- Open windows with offsets, not all in the same location.

NEXT RELEASE:
- Get rid of the commit/discard mechanism, which is counterintuitive.
- Reimplement tip of the day (not supported out-of-the-box by Qt).
