Make the default window size larger.
Save/restore the window geometry in QSettings.

MacOS:
- Toolbar is very bulky; can we make it 22x22, not 32x32?
- Message boxes are all in bold, ugh.

Hunt for instances of pixmap(..,..).

Lock icon on trianglations with surface lists

Mimetype installation on linux desktops

Help->About doesn't list authors/contributors. This is just a matter of
creating it, I can do it but wanted to get it all running so you can
have a look at it.
warnOnNonEmbedded - when enumerating non-embedded surfaces, the dialog
currently has no "Don't warn me again" option. This'll have to be
recreated manually, and we need to pass the value back to ReginaPrefSet
somehow.

Recent files option in the File Menu. As best I found, Qt doesn't offer
this itself, but there's an example at
http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/mainwindows-recentfiles.html

Tip of the day is missing, again Qt doesn't offer anything that does
this as best I can tell.
Mime-type checking, Qt doesn't offer this.
Help button/system for the preferences window.

Undo/Redo actions. This "works" in regular text editor (and script
editor) but nowhere else.

File encoding : imports/exports currently don't do anything about
different file encodings

Python console - Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in
code?

Undocked packet windows : cut/copy/paste have been commented, but as
best I can tell they still work. Is there a menu missing here?

Script editor : Syntax highlighting
