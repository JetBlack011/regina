Clean-up:
- Hunt for dialogs that allow window-close but shouldn't.
- GAPRunner: Fix QDialogButtonBox usage; broken cancel on error.
- Check that we call QWidget::setWindowIcon() for top-level windows.

Appearance:
- Reorganise the Preferences dialog.

Unimplemented:
- Help->About needs to be filled with data.
- Script editor: Syntax highlighting 
- File encoding: imports/exports currently don't do anything about encodings
- Tip of the day is missing (not supported OOTB by Qt).
- Census prefs: system files different; display sensible names during lookup

Commit / discard redesign:
- Get rid of the commit/discard mechanism, which is counterintuitive.
- Simultaneous edits, choose commit (not external) -> not propagated.

Packet pane / dock redesign:
- The dock/undock mechanism is very broken.
- Rejuvenate the PacketPane header, including FlatButton & hard-coded 22px icon
- Open a new file by default, and give the root-level container a better name.
- Undocked panes: cut/copy/paste commented but still works; is a menu missing?

Broken:
- Ensure that the scroll areas actually shrink and allow scrolling.
- MacOS: Cmdline tools (including regina-python) don't work.
- Spaces-per-tab has no effect in NScriptUI.

Other:
- Python console: Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in code?
- Undo/Redo: "works" in regular text/script editors but nowhere else.
- PacketManager: Cache packet icons for performance.

Low-priority:
- Include graphviz in the bundle.
