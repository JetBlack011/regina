Commit / discard redesign:
- Get rid of the commit/discard mechanism, which is counterintuitive.
- Simultaneous edits, choose commit (not external) -> not propagated.

Packet pane / dock redesign:
- The dock/undock mechanism is very broken.
- Rejuvenate the PacketPane header, including FlatButton & hard-coded 22px icon
- Open a new file by default, and give the root-level container a better name.

Edit menu:
- Python console: Edit options, seem to be there, but are commented in code?
- Undocked panes: cut/copy/paste commented but still works; is a menu missing?
- Undo/Redo: "works" in regular text/script editors but nowhere else.

Low-priority:
- MacOS: Include graphviz in the bundle.
- Reimplement tip of the day (not supported out-of-the-box by Qt).

Stephan:
- Document NNormalSurface::boundarySlopes().
- Merge and clean up TONS.

Misc:
- MacOS, Windows: Search for graphviz/GAP in the "usual place".
- Windows: Work out what to do with ~/.regina-libs
- Windows: Find a less confronting icon for documentation
- Windows: View PDF packet breaks (Adobe says cannot open)
